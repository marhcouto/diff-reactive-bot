ABSTRACT = {In this study, a fuzzy logic controller with the reinforcement improved differential search algorithm (FLC_R-IDS) is proposed for solving a mobile robot wall-following control problem. This study uses the reward and punishment mechanisms of reinforcement learning to train the mobile robot wall-following control. The proposed improved differential search algorithm uses parameter adaptation to adjust the control parameters. To improve the exploration of the algorithm, a change in the number of superorganisms is required as it involves a stopover site. This study uses reinforcement learning to guide the behavior of the robot. When the mobile robot satisfies three reward conditions, it gets reward +1. The accumulated reward value is used to evaluate the controller and to replace the next controller training. Experimental results show that, compared with the traditional differential search algorithm and the chaos differential search algorithm, the average error value of the proposed FLC_R-IDS in the three experimental environments is reduced by 12.44%, 22.54% and 25.98%, respectively. Final, the experimental results also show that the real mobile robot using the proposed method can effectively implement the wall-following control.},
